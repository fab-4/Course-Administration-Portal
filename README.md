# Course-Administration-Portal
The Course Administration Portal is designed for an institution’s database handling of students, instructors and the courses they are registered with or they teach. With the help of JDBC and SQL this portal is accessing and manipulating the institution’s database. The administration maintains the data-integrity by assigning a unique pair of ID and password to each student and instructor.


The Administration Database consists of the following tables : 

Instructors (ID, password, name, dept)

Courses(course_name, year, dept, credits, type, prerequisite)

<Name of the course>(roll_no, teacherID, grade)

Y<last 2 digits of the enrolled year>(name, roll_no, password, dept, year)
